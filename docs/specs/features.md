# Kisumu Lang Features

**Kisumu Lang** is a statically-typed programming language crafted for simplicity, performance, and scalability. Inspired by Go, Python, and Rust, Kisumu provides a robust environment for developing modern applications. Below are the key features that define Kisumu Lang and set it apart as a programming language of choice for developers:

## **1. C-Style Syntax**

Kisumu adopts a clean, easy-to-read syntax that feels familiar to developers with experience in C-style languages.

**Example:**

```ksm
int age = 25
if (age > 18) {
    print("Adult")
} else {
    print("Minor")
}
```

## **2. Statically Typed**

Kisumu enforces type safety through its statically-typed nature, ensuring:

- Reduced runtime errors.
- Improved code clarity and maintainability.
- Better optimization by the compiler.

**Example:**

```ksm
string name = "Kisumu"
name = 123 // Compilation error: type mismatch
```

## **3. First-Class Concurrency**

Concurrency is a first-class citizen in Kisumu Lang, offering robust tools for managing concurrent processes:

- **Goroutines**: Lightweight threads for efficient multitasking.
- **Channels**: Safe communication between goroutines.
- **Actor-based Model**: Encapsulation of state and behavior.

**Example:**

```ksm
goroutine fn worker() {
    print("Working...")
}
worker()
```

## **4. Extensibility**

Kisumu supports modular development with a package-based structure, enabling:

- Reusable and organized code.
- Scalable development for large applications.

**Example:**

```ksm
import math

int result = math.add(5, 10)
print(result)
```

## **5. Garbage Collection**

Automatic memory management ensures developers can focus on building functionality without worrying about:

- Memory leaks.
- Manual deallocation of resources.

## **6. Interoperability**

Seamless Foreign Function Interface (FFI) support allows Kisumu programs to:

- Interact with libraries written in C, Go, and other languages.
- Extend functionality without reinventing the wheel.

**Example:**

```ksm
external fn cFunction()
cFunction()
```

## **7. Developer Productivity**

Kisumu includes features aimed at enhancing developer productivity:

- Comprehensive standard library.
- Built-in debugging tools.
- Interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for rapid prototyping.

## **8. Cross-Platform Support**

Write once, run anywhere! Kisumu Lang compiles to multiple platforms, making it suitable for:

- Web development.
- Embedded systems.
- Desktop and server applications.

## **9. Community-Driven**

Kisumu is an open-source language built with input from a global community of developers. Contributions are encouraged to:

- Expand the languageâ€™s ecosystem.
- Improve usability and features.

Kisumu Lang is positioned to meet the demands of modern software development while remaining accessible to both new and experienced developers alike.
