# Architecture Document

## Design Principles

The architecture of Kisumu is guided by the following design principles:

1. **Simplicity**: Ensure that the language and its associated tools are easy to understand and use.
2. **Modularity**: Design components to be independent and reusable, promoting scalability and maintainability.
3. **Performance**: Optimize for speed and efficiency in both the language runtime and its tooling.
4. **Safety**: Employ robust type checking and memory management mechanisms to prevent errors and vulnerabilities.
5. **Extensibility**: Allow for future enhancements and community-driven contributions without compromising the core system.

## High-Level Overview

Kisumu’s architecture comprises the following core components:

1. **Lexer**

   - Tokenizes the source code into meaningful elements (keywords, identifiers, literals, etc.).
   - Ensures compliance with the language’s syntax rules.

2. **Parser**

   - Converts the tokenized input into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
   - Validates the structure of the code for adherence to grammar.

3. **Type Checker**

   - Enforces type safety by verifying type correctness across operations and assignments.
   - Supports static typing to catch errors at compile time.

4. **Code Generator**

   - Translates the AST into executable code or bytecode for the runtime environment.
   - Ensures efficiency and compatibility with target platforms.

5. **Runtime Environment**

   - Executes the generated code.
   - Provides essential services such as memory management, concurrency primitives, and standard I/O.

6. **Standard Library**

   - Offers built-in modules and packages for common tasks like file handling, networking, and mathematical computations.

7. **Tooling**
   - Includes a compiler/interpreter, debugger, and package manager to enhance developer productivity.

## Component Breakdown

### Lexer

- **Input**: Raw source code.
- **Output**: Stream of tokens.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Recognize valid tokens defined in the language specification.
  - Report syntax errors early in the compilation process.

### Parser

- **Input**: Tokens from the lexer.
- **Output**: Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Construct a hierarchical representation of the code.
  - Identify and report structural issues.

### Type Checker

- **Input**: AST.
- **Output**: Annotated AST or error messages.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Validate data types and their operations.
  - Ensure consistency in function calls and variable usage.

### Code Generator

- **Input**: Annotated AST.
- **Output**: Executable code or bytecode.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Optimize code for performance.
  - Generate platform-specific instructions or intermediate representations.

### Runtime Environment

  - Offers flags and options for debugging and optimization.

- **Debugger**:

  - Provides tools for tracing and analyzing program execution.
  - Supports breakpoints, variable inspection, and step-by-step execution.

- **Package Manager**:
  - Manages dependencies and library installations.
  - Facilitates version control and updates.

## Future Considerations

1. **Support for JIT Compilation**:

   - Enhance runtime performance by compiling frequently used code paths on the fly.

2. **Integration with External Tools**:

   - Extend interoperability with tools like IDEs and third-party libraries.

3. **Security Enhancements**:

   - Harden the runtime against vulnerabilities and exploits.

4. **Community Contributions**:
   - Establish guidelines for extensions and plug-ins to foster a thriving ecosystem.
