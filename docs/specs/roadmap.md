# Kisumu Lang Roadmap

Welcome to the **Kisumu Lang** development roadmap! This document outlines our planned milestones, guiding our journey from initial development to a fully-featured and community-driven programming language.

## **Vision Statement**

Kisumu Lang aims to deliver a modern, statically-typed programming language tailored for simplicity, performance, and scalability. Our goal is to empower developers with intuitive tools for building reliable, efficient, and scalable applications while fostering an inclusive community.

## **Phases of Development**

### **Phase 1: Foundation**

**Objective**: Build the core components of Kisumu Lang and establish its fundamental capabilities.

- âœ… **Define Language Specification**: Finalize syntax, semantics, and core features.
- âœ… **Lexer Development**: Create a tokenizer to process Kisumu Lang source code.
- âœ… **Parser Development**: Implement parsing logic for generating an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- âœ… **Basic Data Types**: Introduce essential types like `int`, `string`, and `bool`.
- âœ… **Expression Evaluation**: Enable computation for basic arithmetic and logical operations.
- ðŸ”„ **Error Handling Framework**: Build a robust system for detecting and reporting errors.

### **Phase 2: Core Language Features**

**Objective**: Expand functionality and improve developer experience.

- **Type System**: Add support for user-defined types, arrays, and generics.
- **Concurrency Models**: Implement goroutines, channels, and actor-based systems.
- **Garbage Collection**: Introduce automatic memory management.
- **Interoperability**: Provide FFI for integration with C and Go.
- **Standard Library**: Develop essential libraries for math, I/O, string manipulation, and more.

### **Phase 3: Developer Tools**

**Objective**: Enhance productivity and debugging capabilities.

- **Interactive REPL**: Provide a Read-Eval-Print Loop for quick prototyping.
- **Debugger**: Build debugging tools to aid in identifying and fixing issues.
- **Package Manager**: Introduce a package registry and manager for sharing reusable code.
- **Documentation Framework**: Ensure comprehensive and easily accessible documentation.

### **Phase 4: Cross-Platform Compilation**

**Objective**: Extend Kisumu Lang's compatibility and usability.

- **Platform Support**: Compile Kisumu Lang code for Windows, macOS, Linux, and embedded devices.
- **WebAssembly**: Support for compiling to WebAssembly for browser-based applications.

### **Phase 5: Community and Ecosystem**

**Objective**: Foster an active community and vibrant ecosystem.

- **Open-Source Launch**: Make the project publicly accessible on GitHub.
- **Community Contributions**: Encourage contributions for libraries, tools, and language features.
- **Governance Model**: Establish transparent decision-making processes for the project.
