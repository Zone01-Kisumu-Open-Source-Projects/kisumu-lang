# Introduction

## Overview

Kisumu is an innovative, statically-typed programming language designed with simplicity, scalability, and performance at its core. It draws inspiration from Go’s robust concurrency model, Python’s user-friendly syntax, and Rust’s focus on memory safety. This project aims to address challenges in modern software development by providing developers with a tool that balances accessibility and power.

## Vision

Kisumu aspires to empower developers with a language that:

- **Simplifies programming** while retaining advanced capabilities.
- **Enhances productivity** through intuitive design and modern features.
- **Promotes scalability** for projects of any size, from small scripts to large-scale systems.
- **Ensures safety and reliability** with a robust type system and memory management.

## Mission

The mission of Kisumu is to build a programming language that seamlessly blends ease of use with advanced technical features, fostering innovation and creativity within the software development community.

## Target Audience

Kisumu is tailored for:

- **Software developers** seeking a language that prioritizes simplicity and efficiency.
- **Educators and learners** looking for an accessible yet powerful tool for teaching and learning programming concepts.
- **Embedded systems enthusiasts** in need of a lightweight and performant language for hardware applications.
- **Open-source contributors** eager to collaborate on an ambitious and impactful project.

## Key Goals

1. **Accessibility**: Offer a syntax that is beginner-friendly yet comprehensive for advanced users.
2. **Performance**: Provide efficient execution for compute-intensive tasks and real-time applications.
3. **Concurrency**: Implement robust concurrency models inspired by Go to support modern development needs.
4. **Interoperability**: Enable seamless integration with other programming languages through a Foreign Function Interface (FFI).
5. **Modularity**: Support a modular architecture to promote code reuse and scalability.

## Scope

The Kisumu programming language will initially focus on:

- Implementing a **core language specification** that includes essential features such as type definitions, concurrency primitives, and error handling.
- Providing a **standard library** with support for common tasks like file handling, networking, and mathematical operations.
- Developing **tools and utilities** to facilitate the language’s adoption, including a compiler/interpreter, a package manager, and debugging tools.
- Building a **collaborative community** to expand and maintain the language’s ecosystem.

## Why Kisumu?

While numerous programming languages exist, Kisumu stands out by:

- Combining **Python’s simplicity**, **Go’s concurrency**, and **Rust’s safety** in a single language.
- Offering a tailored solution for **general-purpose programming** and **embedded systems development**.
- Focusing on **developer experience** with comprehensive documentation, error messages, and learning resources.

This document sets the foundation for Kisumu’s development. We invite contributors, educators, and enthusiasts to join us on this journey to create a language that will redefine software development. Let’s make Kisumu a reality together!
